This addon covers a very limited operation in an earlier version of parent
addon `account_payment_partner` (payment mode is only editable for invoices
in draft state).

For later versions this is accomplished in a more accurate way (not reconciled
invoices, even published, enables payment mode edition). So this addon is
unneccesary in such addon version state.
